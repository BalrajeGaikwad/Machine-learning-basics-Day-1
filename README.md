Machine learning 

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves developing algorithms that can recognize patterns, analyze data, and improve performance over time.

Key Components of Machine Learning

1. Data – The foundation of ML. Clean and structured data is essential for accurate predictions.


2. Features – Attributes or variables used to make predictions. Feature engineering improves model performance.


3. Algorithms – Mathematical models that learn from data. Examples include decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines.


4. Model Training – The process of feeding data into an algorithm so it can learn patterns and relationships.


5. Evaluation – Measuring model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.



Types of Machine Learning

1. Supervised Learning – Models learn from labeled data.

Examples:

Classification (e.g., spam detection, image recognition)

Regression (e.g., predicting house prices, stock market trends)




2. Unsupervised Learning – Models learn from unlabeled data to find patterns.

Examples:

Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation, anomaly detection)

Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE)




3. Reinforcement Learning – Models learn through trial and error using rewards.

Examples:

Robotics

Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo)





Common ML Algorithms

Linear Regression – Predicts continuous values

Logistic Regression – Used for binary classification

Decision Trees – Splits data into branches for decision making

Random Forest – An ensemble of decision trees

Support Vector Machines (SVM) – Finds the best boundary between classes

Neural Networks – Mimics the human brain for deep learning


Model Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy – Correct predictions out of total predictions

Precision – How many predicted positives are actually positive

Recall – How many actual positives were correctly predicted

F1 Score – Harmonic mean of precision and recall

2. Data Preprocessing (Cleaning, Feature Engineering)


3. Model Selection


4. Model Training


5. Model Evaluation
